 Workflow Dependency Node

  A workflow dependency node always belongs to exactly one workflow, where a workflow has a workflow dependency node for each path component.
  These nodes are always connected to their parent node - the node that belongs to the parent path.

  There can be only one node per path within this parent child relationship, however there can be `n` different nodes per path (created by other workflows).
